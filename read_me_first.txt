Demonstration File - Use This:

	- This workfolder provides an annotated, working demonstration script for the open data portal for Ireland;
	- The script calls the CKAN API for the open data portal for Ireland and returns metadata for all data packages;
	- Metadata is analysed and outputted to .csv files in the workfolder;
	- If you wish to test the script, you will need to download the entire workfolder and run the script from within the workfolder.

	DEPENDENCIES:

	- Also in the workfolder are outputs from the Screaming Frog web crawler run on the open data portal for Ireland. These
	are a dependency for the script to execute;
	- A five-star data look-up table is also included in the workfolder, which is required for the script to execute; 
	- In order to run the file you need to have a copy of R or R Studio installed. If you have R Studio installed, you can
	run the R Project file instead (you may need to load the R script from within R Studio though);
	- There are several package dependencies included in the script. If you do no have these packages installed, please do
	so before executing it.
